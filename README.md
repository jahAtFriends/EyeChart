# Eye Chart Project

In this project, you will practice modular programming by using pre-defined
methods according to their specifications. As with your previous project, this
will be accomplished using the Processing environment, and your finished
project will be an artistic _Eye Chart_.

## Description

Your task is to convert a famous speech or bit of literature into an
aesthetically pleasing Eye Chart. From whatever text you select, you should
determine the most used word (methods for this will be supplied here) and type
it in large font at the top of the Eye Chart. Lesser-used words should appear
beneath it in smaller font. Some examples of finished products are below.
